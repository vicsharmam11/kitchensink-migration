# Kitchensink Migration Project

This project demonstrates the migration of the legacy JBoss Kitchensink application to a modern platform using **Spring Boot** and **MongoDB**, with JWT-based security implemented for authentication and authorization.

## Features
- **Spring Boot** as the application framework.
- **MongoDB** as the database.
- **JWT-based authentication** for secure API access.
- CRUD operations for members.
- Comprehensive validation and exception handling.
- Role-based access control for `ADMIN` and `USER` roles.
- Unit tests using **JUnit 5** and **Mockito**.
- Simple frontend UI for interacting with APIs.

---

## Prerequisites
- Java 21 installed.
- MongoDB instance running locally or remotely.
- Maven for dependency management.
- A tool like Postman or a browser to interact with APIs.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
$ git clone <repository-url>
$ cd kitchensink
```

### 2. Setup MongoDB
Ensure MongoDB is running locally or remotely. Update the connection string in `application.properties`:
```properties
spring.application.name=kitchensink
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/admin
```

### 3. Build the Application
```bash
$ mvn clean install
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```
The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Endpoints

### Authentication
- **POST** `/api/auth/login`
- Request Body:
```json
{
"username": "admin",
"password": "password"
}
```
- Response:
```json
{
"Authorization": "bearer <JWT_TOKEN>"
}
```

### Member APIs (Requires JWT in `Authorization` Header)

#### Create Member
- **POST** `/api/members`
- Headers:
```
Authorization: bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```
- Request Body:
```json
{
"name": "John Doe",
"email": "john.doe@example.com",
"phone": "1234567890"
}
```
- Response:
```json
{
"id": "<member_id>",
"name": "John Doe",
"email": "john.doe@example.com",
"phone": "1234567890"
}
```

#### Get Member by ID
- **GET** `/api/members/{id}`
- Headers:
```
Authorization: bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```
- Response:
```json
{
"id": "<member_id>",
"name": "John Doe",
"email": "john.doe@example.com",
"phone": "1234567890"
}
```

#### Update Member
- **PUT** `/api/members/{id}`
- Headers:
```
Authorization: bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```
- Request Body:
```json
{
"name": "Jane Doe",
"email": "jane.doe@example.com",
"phone": "0987654321"
}
```
- Response:
```json
{
"id": "<member_id>",
"name": "Jane Doe",
"email": "jane.doe@example.com",
"phone": "0987654321"
}
```

#### Delete Member
- **DELETE** `/api/members/{id}`
- Headers:
```
Authorization: bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```
- Response:
```json
{
"message": "Member deleted successfully."
}
```

## Running Unit Tests
Unit tests are implemented using **JUnit 5** and **Mockito**. Run the tests with the following command:
```bash
$ mvn test
```

---

## Frontend UI
A simple HTML page is included to interact with the APIs. Open the `index.html` file in your browser and:
1. Log in to get a JWT token.
2. Use the token to interact with secured APIs (e.g., create, update, delete members).
